# Project Proposal

## Abstract

Our project focuses on analyzing the accessibility of healthcare facilities for residents in Malaysia. 

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that aids users to effortlessly perform kernel density estimation and model geographic accessibility. The web application will visualize the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities across our focus area using kernel density estimation techniques. This will provide insights into areas with high and low concentrations of healthcare services. Further modelling of geographic accessibility will also tell us how easy it is for residents to travel to these healthcare facilities from the residential areas.

This application provides users with accessible geospatial analysis outcomes on Malaysia’s healthcare data without the need for programming skills.

## Project Motivation

Our project is motivated by the findings indicating that public hospitals in Johor Bahru (JB) provide commendable cleanliness, robust equipment, and friendly staff, as evidenced by research. Therefore, we seek to analyse the accessibility of these healthcare facilities to residents. 

Given JB's infrastructure differences compared to Kuala Lumpur (KL), particularly in public transport, our project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of JB's healthcare network accessibility and compare it with KL's. KL's better developed public transport system offers a perspective for understanding potential enhancements to healthcare accessibility in JB. By juxtaposing these two cities, our study aims to provide valuable insights to urban planners, facilitating informed decisions to improve healthcare accessibility for all residents.

## Approach to task

1.  Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides users with contextual insights into the regions where frequent seismic activities occur.
2.  Conduct a first-order spatial analysis
    a.  Plotting kernel density estimation to visualize area with higher density of earthquake occurrences, identify hotspots
3.  Conduct second-order spatial analysis
    a.  To learn whether the locations of healthcare facilities in Malaysia is randomly distributed or clustered and find out which areas are the facilities highly concentrated at
4.  Modelling geographical accessibility
    a.  to compute accessibility measure by using Hansen’s potential model and Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM)

    b.  Visualise the accessibility measure using tmap and ggplot2 packages

## Data Source

The building and road data of Malaysia was sourced from [OpenStreetMap](https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html) that provides us with the residential buildings and road network in Malaysia.

Malaysia’s healthcare data was also sourced from [OpenStreetMap](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_mys_health_facilities) that provides us with the address of all the healthcare facilities in Malaysia.
